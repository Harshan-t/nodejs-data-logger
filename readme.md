Project: Simple Registration Form

    - server.js: The Node.js server file that creates an HTTP server and handles form submissions.
    - index.html: The HTML file that contains the registration form.
    - style.css: The CSS file that styles the registration form.
    
How to Run:
    - Clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    - Run node server.js to start the server.
    - Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the registration form.
